## About the Project
While creating a game engine, I came across this ImGui addon called [ImGuiColorTextEdit](https://github.com/BalazsJako/ImGuiColorTextEdit). 

I couldn't find proper documentation on how to use it. Sure, ChatGPT can help me understand how it works and how to use it. But, for some people, a well-structured documentation is still much more preferable to look for.
