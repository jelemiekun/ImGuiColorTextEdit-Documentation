## About the Project
While creating a game engine, I came across this ImGui addon called [ImGuiColorTextEdit](https://github.com/BalazsJako/ImGuiColorTextEdit). 

I couldn't find proper documentation on how to use it. Sure, ChatGPT can help me understand how it works and how to use it. But, for some people, a well-structured documentation is still much more preferable to look for.

## Documentation Structure
Each class or struct in ImGuiColorTextEdit is documented using a consistent and readable layout. Every page follows this structure:

1. Overview
A brief explanation of what the class or struct represents, its purpose, and how it fits into the TextEditor system.

2. Member Structs / Nested Types
Lists and describes any nested types (such as inner structs, enums, or helper types) defined inside the class/struct.

3. Member Variables
Provides an organized table of all member fields

4. Member Functions
Details the public (and occasionally private/internal, if relevant) functions exposed by the class/struct.

5. Example Usage
A short, focused code snippet showing how the class/struct is typically used.
